Traders usually seek to profit on fluctuations in price that take place within one day, many days, many weeks, or even many months, but often not many years unless one is a long-term investor. These trades are often driven by events like company earnings/financial announcements, important company news, general market condition, or advanced technical analysis of the stock. Trading is usually a complex and risky endeavor that one should only pursue after having a solid understanding of the fundamentals of the market.\"\n                    }, void 0, false, {\n                      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                      lineNumber: 230,\n                      columnNumber: 23\n                    }, this)]\n                  }, void 0, true, {\n                    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                    lineNumber: 222,\n                    columnNumber: 21\n                  }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"section\", {\n                    children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Typography, {\n                      id: \"but_how_do_I_buy_a_share_in_the_first_place\",\n                      children: \"\\u200E\"\n                    }, void 0, false, {\n                      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                      lineNumber: 250,\n                      columnNumber: 23\n                    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Typography, {\n                      className: classes.subtopic,\n                      variant: \"h2\",\n                      children: \"But how do I buy a share in the first place?\"\n                    }, void 0, false, {\n                      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                      lineNumber: 254,\n                      columnNumber: 23\n                    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Typography, {\n                      className: classes.paragraph,\n                      variant: \"body1\",\n                      children: [\"Let's say you want to buy a share from Apple, it is not as simple as going to\", \" \", /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"a\", {\n                        className: classes.linkText,\n                        href: \"http://apple.com\",\n                        children: \"apple.com\"\n                      }, void 0, false, {\n                        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                        lineNumber: 261,\n                        columnNumber: 25\n                      }, this), \" \", \"and just click \\\"buy share\\\" or whatever.

Think about what happen to your money when\n                        you store it. By default, your money loses it value over\n                        time. This is caused by something called inflation, a\n                        situation where the purchasing power of your currency\n                        decreases and the prices of goods increase.

For most developed countries, inflation is generally\n                        around 2%, which means that stuffs cost about 2% more\n                        every year than the year it did before. For example, in\n                        the 70s, a cup of coffee cost about 50 cents, probably\n                        less. But now a cup of coffee usually cost about $1 or\n                        $2. So if you were to store $1000 under your bed or\n                        something, then for the next 5 or 10 years time your\n                        $1000 would not be worth $1000 anymore because\n                        everything would have increase in price by about 2% each\n                        year. This is not a good situation because the value of\n                        your money fallen over time. Even if you were to store\n                        your money in a bank for example, which usually has an\n                        interest rate of about 0.5%, you would still loses your\n                        money because inflation rate is higher.\n                      </Typography>\n\n                      <Typography className={classes.paragraph} variant=\"body1\">\n                        Of course, there are also many other reasons for why\n                        people start investing, but inflation is usually the\n                        main reason. With all that said, how do we actually make\n                        money from investment? Well, imagine a hypothetical\n                        savings account that gives us a 10% interest rate each\n                        year. So if you initially have $1000, then in 10 years\n                        time your money will have become roughly $2600. If we\n                        adjust for inflation, you would still have about $2100.\n                        This is obviously very good since we have more than\n                        doubled our money by just putting it in a hypothetical\n                        saving account. Unfortunately, this hypothetical 10%\n                        interest rate saving account doesn&apos;t really exist\n                        in real life, because the value is just way too high and\n                        unrealistic. So what other options do we have to save\n                        our money?\n                      </Typography>\n                    </section>\n\n                    <section>\n                      {/* Empty padding */}\n                      <Typography id=\"what_is_investing\">‎</Typography>\n\n                      <Typography className={classes.subtopic} variant=\"h2\">\n                        What is investing?\n                      </Typography>\n\n                      <Typography className={classes.paragraph} variant=\"body1\">\n                        Investing is the act of putting your money into various\n                        financial instruments (in this guide, we&apos;ll be\n                        focusing on stocks) in the hopes of that instrument\n                        increasing in value, thus providing you with a profit.\n                        This allows you to generate a separate income outside of\n                        your job that can be used later in life.

The easiest way is\n                        to look at the company&apos;s market value, also known\n                        as market capitalization (or market cap). Calculating\n                        market cap is pretty simple; for example, if a company\n                        has 20 million shares outstanding and its share price is\n                        $10, then the market cap is $200 million. In the stock\n                        market, the size of a company is measured by its market\n                        cap.

Nano caps are very risky\n                              because they are such small companies and are\n                              particularly prone to manipulation.

In general, large cap stocks are\n                        considered safer than small cap stocks. However, small\n                        cap stocks have greater potential for growth. Although\n                        market cap is an important factor to consider, one must\n                        not invest based solely on it as there are other\n                        important factors as well.\n                      </Typography>\n                    </section>\n\n                    <section>\n                      {/* Empty padding */}\n                      <Typography
